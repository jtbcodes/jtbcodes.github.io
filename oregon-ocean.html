    <h1>Why We Shouldn't Go On Haystack Rock</h1>
    <p>This is Haystack Rock.</p>

    <p>When you step on the barnacles with shoes on, you can knock off the barnacles. If you don't have shoes on, you would cut your feet on them. The use for barnacles are that birds can eat them.</p>

    <p>Humans can eat this type of barnacle too, which are gooseneck barnacles.</p>

    <p>When you step on the rock, you can knock off seaweed, which when it is covered by water, it is like an underwater forest and a hiding place for some fish and food for other fish.</p>

    <p>When you go on Haystack Rock, there are often bird nests on them, and birds get startled very easily. You could scare them away. They can even knock their eggs or little baby birds off of their nests, or be so frightened that they don't come back.</p>

    <p>So basically how we affect the rock and other rocks would affect us.</p>
